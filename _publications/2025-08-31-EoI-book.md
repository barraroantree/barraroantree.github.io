## Abstract
The Economy of Ireland considers the evolution of the Irish economy over time; the policy priorities for a small regional economy in the eurozone; the role of the state in policy making; taxation and regulatory policy; and the challenge of sustainable development. This provides a framework for analysing policy issues at a national level, including the Irish labour market and migration, inequality and poverty, and the care economy. The book then considers issues at a sectoral level, from agriculture and trade to the education and health sectors.

Fully updated with the latest available data, contemporary examples and references, as well as discussion and analysis of current topical issues, all chapters have been extensively revised for the new edition. With two brand new chapters on Behavioural Economics and Demography, and updated material and analysis on taxation, inequality, sustainable development and ethics, this is an ideal text for students studying modules on Irish Economics.
